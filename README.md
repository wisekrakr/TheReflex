# TheReflex
First Unity3D game. Dodge the boxes

A simple game where the player needs to dodge blocks untill reaching the finish line.

This game was made the learn the basics of Unity3D. It literally took me 4 hours to make, with no previous knowledge of Unity3D
or C# or Visual Studio.

Topics: 

Player
Player Movement
Obstacles
Collisions
Camera
Multiple Scenes
Ui
Coding in Visual Studio with C#

With these basics implemented, this already looks like a game.

Play the game by going to /TheReflex/Builds/V.2/TheReflex.exe
